**Triumph & Tragedy I** was a national-level grand-strategy game released under the RP namespace. As such, you can find their current versions in distinct repositories from RP1-RP5.2, all of which are now separately maintained for polish and ease of use. The features added are placed next to each repository's denotation.

Since 2022, **Triumph & Tragedy I** has been replaced by **Triumph & Tragedy II** which overhauled nearly all legacy aspects of the game into a cogent multiplayer-focused grand-strategy game with detailed and realistic combat, demographic, economic, military, and political mechanics.

- RP5.2 (National Modifiers, Balancing Changes)
- RP5.1 (RP5 Stabilisation and Bugfixes, Changes to Army Combat)
- RP5 (Troop Movement and Province Supply; Air Combat)
- RP4 (Combat, Political, Reforms, Technology, Unit Overhauls; Provinces and Cities. Automated Mapping)
- RP3 (National-level Mostly Automated NRP with Combat Calculators)
- RP2 (National-level NRP improved from RP1)
- RP1 (Similar to Country Battle, national-level NRP with no map)
