## Abstract.

**Triumph & Tragedy I** was a national-level grand-strategy game released under the RP namespace. As such, you can find their current versions in distinct repositories from RP1-RP5.2, all of which are now separately maintained for polish and ease of use. The features added are placed next to each repository's denotation.

Since 2022, **Triumph & Tragedy I** has been replaced by **Triumph & Tragedy II** which overhauled nearly all legacy aspects of the game into a cogent multiplayer-focused grand-strategy game with detailed and realistic combat, demographic, economic, military, and political mechanics.
